Final model we used is a Linear Regression model with params - Postcode, Brand, FuelCode, Date
We abanded Address as we believe there isn't much correlation with the fuel price
Best results was using Random Forest model however, it was unable to work when it sees new values
Linear regression provide decent results too which is why we ended up with this model
